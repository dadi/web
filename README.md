## Overview

DADI Web is a high performance, schema-less templating layer built on Node.JS. it can operate as a stand-alone platform or in conjunction with [DADI API](https://github.com/dadi/api) as a full stack web application.

DADI Web makes it easy to build custom enterprise-grade Node.JS applications. Easily create static pages or connect to APIs to generate data-driven pages giving you the power to search, paginate, sort and filter your data.

DADI Web uses LinkedIn's Dust templating language which provides a simple yet powerful template layer for displaying your data. It has built in support for: Rotating log files, Nginx-style HTTP access logs, GZip compression, caching by mime-type, URL rewriting, database-backed sessions and more.

DADI Web is part of [DADI](https://github.com/dadi/), a suite of components covering the full development stack, built for performance and scale.

## Requirements

* **[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/)** (supported versions: 4.7.0, 5.12.0, 6.9.2)

## Your first Web project

### Install Web

All DADI platform microservices are available from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). To add *Web* to your project as a dependency:

```bash
$ cd my-app
$ npm install --save @dadi/web
```

As part of the installation process of the `@dadi/web` package, several files and folders were added to your project:

* `config/config.development.json`
* `workspace/`
* `server.js`

This enables Web to boot straight out of the box with a default ‘blog’ style configuration and some suggestions of next steps. Start the server and open a browser to begin.

### Start the server

With the `server.js` in the root of your application, Web can be started from the command line simply by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

With the default configuration, our Web server is available at http://localhost:3001. Visit this URL in your browser to see a 'Welcome' page.

### Configuration

Web requires a configuration file specific to the application environment. For example in the production environment it will look for a file named `config.production.json`.

Configuration files live in a `config` folder in your application root, for example `config/config.development.json`. Web starts with a sensible default configuration, but you can find full configuration documentation at http://docs.dadi.tech/web/getting-started/configuration/.

#### Run Web as a service

To run your Web application in the background as a service, install Forever and Forever Service:

```bash
$ npm install forever forever-service -g

$ forever-service install -s server.js -e NODE_ENV=production web --start
```

You can now interact with the `web` service using the following commands:

```bash
$ [sudo] service web start
$ [sudo] service web stop
$ [sudo] service web status
$ [sudo] service web restart
```

> Note: the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` must be set to the required configuration version matching the configuration files available in the `config` directory.
